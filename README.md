Even through I need to fix a lot of ___bugs___ in styles. But without they I don't even know how to config all of that.

## Why there is Arch logo ?
Well it is my network signal. I can't find any good looking wifi bar so I decide to use the speed and my favorite browsers. But I can't find brave icon so linux distro fix that. Some time it confused but ! I use Arch btw.

__Fact:__ I put Internet explorer at the less wifi bar.
