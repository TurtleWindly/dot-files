## Dependencies

### Everythings
```sh
sudo dnf remove compton
sudo dnf install xautolock rofi sox polybar picom viewnior scrot terminator nodejs lollypop
```

#### unikey
You will need to change the input method. I do it using xfce4 settings. Having xfce4 along i3 is pretty good.
```sh
sudo dnf install ibus-unikey
```

#### i3-gaps
```sh
sudo dnf remove i3
sudo dnf copr enable fuhrmann/i3-gaps
sudo dnf install i3-gaps
```

Even through I need to fix a lot of ___bugs___ in styles. But without they I don't even know how to config all of that.

## Why there is Arch logo ?
Well it is my network signal. I can't find any good looking wifi bar so I decide to use the speed and my favorite browsers. But I can't find brave icon so linux distro fix that. Some time it confused but ! I use Arch btw.

__Fact:__ I put Internet explorer at the less wifi bar.
